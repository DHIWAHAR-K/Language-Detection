# Language Detection in Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the implementation of language detection using the `langdetect` library. The provided script allows users to input text, and the language of the text is automatically detected. Explore this script to understand the basics of language detection in Python using pre-trained models.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the `langdetect` library (if not already installed).
- **User Input:** Code for user input to provide text for language detection.
- **Language Detection:** Utilizing the `langdetect` library to detect the language of the input text.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the detected language to the user.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required library by running `pip install langdetect` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`language_detection.py`) in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input text for language detection.
4. The script will display the detected language of the input text.

## Customization

- Explore other language detection libraries or models for different accuracy levels.
- Modify the script to work with larger text samples or multiple sentences.
- Adapt the code to include additional information about the detected language.
